SMA Sketch Description

The website will have a long scrolling front static page to display 90% of the content.

1
This page will have a looping backround of animated clouds. The center focus will be the logo. To the left will display the address of the school, to the right will be an email address and phone number.

2
When you scroll down the animated background will be replaced with a contemporary and minimalist background. A menu will appear as you scroll down and stick to the top of the viewport (window). Below the menu will be icons to all social media accounts as well as the yelp page. Beneath this will be a slider or carasoel which will display a high resolution image from a recent school event. Ideally I would like to be present for the event to take some high resolution images for social media and the website.

Continuing on down the page will be 4 card slots. Each slot will display the programs the academy offers. It will display a call-to-action description with a button below it.

3
Clicking the button will open what is called a "modal". Here will be more information on that specific program.
