                <p> Smithville Montessori Academy III opened its doors on February 4th, 2002 in the Major Mall. We wanted to create an environment for children that would be individualized for learning, which would allow children to progress at their own pace creating an exceptional environment for children to develop. The facility expanded in November of 2002 to include an extended day area and a full time Kindergarten program.
                    <br>
                    <br>Smithville Montessori Academy is committed to providing an enriching, yet challenging, educational environment where each student is encouraged to grow to his or her fullest potential academically, emotionally, physically, socially,and morally. We strive to create an environment that inspires children to develop inner discipline, self-assurance and a love for learning. Our respect for the uniqueness of each child helps to develop lifelong skills during periods of their greatest readiness and sensitivity. We also help parents work toward these same goals at home to empower teachers and staff to remain focused on the mission.</p>

                        <h3>The Montessori Method- What Is It?</h3>
                        <p>The Montessori method is a hands on and unique approach to your child's education. The method is named after Dr. Maria Montessori and her scientific observations while she worked with institutionalized and inner-city children.
                            <br>
                            <br>She began to note that if given developmentally appropriate materials, resources, and the freedom to follow their interests, children were eager to learn. This is the basis behind the Montessori Method, to foster a child's natural inclination to learn.
                            <br>
                            <br>In a Montessori setting teachers guide rather than instruct, allowing children to find activities that meet their interest, needs, and developmental level.</p>

                        <h3>Every child learns in their own unique way.</h3>
                        <p>We believe each child should be valued as a unique individual because not all children learn the same. Students are free to learn at their own pace, and with whichever method works best for them. They develop and progress at their own pace, while being guided by the teacher.
                            <br>
                            <br>Students are allowed freedom to learn their way, within the limits of the classroom. This is achievable because internal satisfaction drives a child's curiosity and interest in learning - even after they are out of school. As each student matures they learn to look critically at their work and become adept at correcting and learning from their errors.</p>

Your child will practice the basic's such as how to tie their shoes, how to clean up a spill,or even how to water plants. As we mentioned, children at this age are curious and want to explore which means a child will happily attain this information through repetition.

Coming from a more traditional daycare previously we were new to the Montessori style of education but the teachers quickly helped our kids to adapt and thrive.
                                    <br>The quality of education and preparation for school has been outstanding. It was a relief to hear from the school district that our son tested ahead of the curve on the principles necessary for entering kindergarten as well as some for 1st grade. All because of the fun way that SMA challenged him to learn. We see The same now with our daughter as she works through The primary classes. The teachers at SMA care about our kids, guide them, help them and we feel very blessed to be a part of the SMA family.</p>

She’s now almost 3 years old and I’m amazed every week with the knowledge she’s gained from the curriculum in the classrooms. Kassidy and Cindy do such an amazing job in the primary room with her. They are teaching her lessons that will prepare her academically as well as giving her the skills to become a respectful young lady. The passion the teachers have for preparing the children for life is clearly evident as my daughter begs to go to school every morning. We couldn’t have made a better choice for our daughter. Erica is always available to talk with and she provides multiple avenues of communication for convenience. I can rest easy knowing that our daughter will be prepared when Kindergarten rolls around. Thanks SMA for everything you do! You ROCK!</p>
