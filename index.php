			   Smithville Montessori Academy III opened its doors on February 4th, 2002 in the Major Mall. We wanted to create an environment for children that would be individualized for learning, which would allow children to progress at their own pace creating an exceptional environment for children to develop. The facility expanded in November of 2002 to include an extended day area and a full time Kindergarten program.<br>
               <br>Smithville Montessori Academy is committed to providing an enriching, yet challenging, educational environment where each student is encouraged to grow to his or her fullest potential academically, emotionally, physically, socially,and morally. We strive to create an environment that inspires children to develop inner discipline, self-assurance and a love for learning. Our respect for the uniqueness of each child helps to develop lifelong skills during periods of their greatest readiness and sensitivity. We also help parents work toward these same goals at home to empower teachers and staff to remain focused on the mission. </div>

                            <h3>The Montessori Method- What Is It?</h3>
                            <p>The Montessori method is a hands on and unique approach to your child's education. The method is named after Dr. Maria Montessori and her scientific observations while she worked with institutionalized and inner-city children.
                                <br>
                                <br>She began to note that if given developmentally appropriate materials, resources, and the freedom to follow their interests, children were eager to learn. This is the basis behind the Montessori Method, to foster a child's
                                natural inclination to learn.
                                <br>
                                <br>In a Montessori setting teachers guide rather than instruct, allowing children to find activities that meet their interest, needs, and developmental level.</p>

                            <h3>Every child learns in their own unique way.</h3>
                            <p>We believe each child should be valued as a unique individual because not all children learn the same. Students are free to learn at their own pace, and with whichever method works best for them. They develop and progress at
                                their own pace, while being guided by the teacher.
                                <br>
                                <br>Students are allowed freedom to learn their way, within the limits of the classroom. This is achievable because internal satisfaction drives a child's curiosity and interest in learning - even after they are out of school.
                                As each student matures they learn to look critically at their work and become adept at correcting and learning from their errors.</p>
                            <h3>Students are part of a close and caring community.</h3>
                            <p>Students will be in a multi-age classroom starting with Infants from 6 weeks to 14 months while toddlers are from 14 months to 2 1/2 years.
                                <br>
                                <br>After this there is Pre-Primary (for children not potty trained) which includes children from 2 1/2 years to 3 1/2 years. If your child is in the age range but is potty trained they will move into Primary. These age groups
                                creates a family structure. Younger students will look up to older students as mentors and even role models.
                                <br>
                                <br>This gives younger students a friendly environment where they feel supported and allows them to gain the confidence to try new challenges. In the classroom, Teachers model respect, loving kindness, and a belief in peaceful
                                conflict resolution.</p>

                        <h3>Infants (6 weeks – 14 months)</h3>
                        <p>The Infant and Toddler years are arguably the most crucial to a child's personality and intellectual development. The Smithville Montessori Academy infant program creates a lifelong passion for learning. Music and movement are
                            among the best resources children can use to become familiar with their surroundings.</p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <h3>Toddlers (14 months - 2 1/2 years)</h3>
                        <p>The classroom offers space for movement, individual work, and group activities. Our approach to learning offers toddlers opportunities to work on the development of art and language skills as well as musical sensory. We use a number
                            of multi-sensory, sequential, and self-correcting Montessori materials to facilitate learning.
                            <br>
                            <br>A carefully planned series of successes build upon inner confidence in the child, This confidence assures him that he can learn by himself. We nourish the child’s self esteem through repeated successes with these activities.
                            These confidence-building activities likewise contribute to the child’s healthy emotional development.
                            <br>
                            <br>Through song and dance, and freedom of choice, the toddlers have access to a variety of large muscle activities that offer them opportunities to jump, climb, balance, crawl, or skip indoors and out. These exercises as well
                            as creative art activities are offered for each child to choose. This freedom in a safe space is crucial to the toddler program.</p>

                                    cultural areas. With the guidance of a teacher your child is free to learn their own materials and develop their fine motor skills as well as explore activities in all areas of the classroom.</p>

                        <h3>What Do We Mean "Practical Life"?</h3>
                        <p>Practical life is an umbrella term for everyday living, it serves to develop your child's sense of order, coordination, and independence. Your child will practice the basic's such as how to tie their shoes, how to clean up a spill,
                            or even how to water plants. As we mentioned, children at this age are curious and want to explore which means a child will happily attain this information through repetition. Your child will learn how to care for themselves,
                            others, and the classroom. </p>
                        <h3>Sensory Education</h3>
                        <p>It is important to allow children to develop their senses, which is why we focus a portion of this class to sensory. Dr. Montessori designed materials specifically for sensory to focus on visual discrimination and to help refine
                            and develop the five senses. Through this, your child will explore the classification, contrasting, and comparison of color, shape, smell, feel, temperature, weights, and textures.</p>
                        <h3>Language</h3>
                        <p>In this area you will find different exercises that expose the child to new vocabulary. The different aspects of language truly come to life without undue stress to the child. Peer interactions are encouraged as well as any other
                            opportunities for meaningful interactions. These interactions really blossom as the child gains self-confidence as well as a larger vocabulary. This is all very crucial to every child's development and should be a priority
                            as they grow and develop.</p>

                        <h3>Mathematics</h3>
                        <p>Dr. Montessori believed in introducing children to the big picture before moving to the smaller portions. You will commonly see children introduced to the decimal system and working on 4 digit addition rather than single digit.
                            These concepts are taught by teachers and it is not until the child can display a concrete understanding that they are introduced to different methods of thinking. At this point, the child is free to continually explore math
                            materials without fear or anxiety.</p>
                        <h3>Cultural</h3>
                        <p>A young child's mind is an absorbent one. Dr. Montessori believes the absorbent mind allows children to take in all there is to offer. By introducing your child to these topics and subjects at a young age they are able to recall
                            it later on in their academic years. You will see children listening to different styles of music or looking at different well known artists, diversity is encouraged in this setting. The cultural area allows the child to gain
                            a better appreciation for each other.</p>
